# Elden-ring-Auto-Updater

Go into config.yaml and change the cooppassword to whatever your want it to be, and set EldenRingPath to the path to the eldenring game directory it should look like this
`C:\\steam\\steamapps\\common\\eldenring\\game` for windows or if your on linux I really hope you know the path to it.
